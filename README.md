This project focuses on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about vehicles available in the USA.       
The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and insights related to vehicle pricing and how it varies across several key factors, including odometer readings, brand, transmission type, body type, and paint color.
